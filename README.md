In order to develop this simple Java application we made the following assumptions:
1. All animals acted deterministically and immediately unless otherwise stated.
2. The Zookeeper was the only employee.
3. The Zoo had a constant number of animals, one of each type, specified at the beginning.
4. Rules stayed consistent between days.

During development, we encountered the following issues:
1. Unfamiliarity with Java resulted in dependency issues between packages in subdirectories. These issues were eventually resolved after a sufficient amount of Googling and debugging.

To run the application:
1. Install Java 8, if not already installed
2. Download the repository.
3. Navigate to the directory containing myZoo.java
4. Execute javac myZoo.java
5. Execute java myZoo
6. Enter the number of days you'd like the zoo to run.
