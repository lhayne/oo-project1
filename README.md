<h3>In order to develop this simple Java application we made the following assumptions:</h3>
1. All animals acted deterministically and immediately unless otherwise stated. <br>
2. The Zookeeper was the only employee. <br>
3. The Zoo had a constant number of animals, one of each type, specified at the beginning. <br>
4. Rules stayed consistent between days. <br>

<h3>During development, we encountered the following issues:</h3>
1. Unfamiliarity with Java resulted in dependency issues between packages in subdirectories. These issues were eventually resolved after a sufficient amount of Googling and debugging. <br>

<h3>To run the application:</h3>
1. Install Java 8, if not already installed <br>
2. Download the repository. <br>
3. Navigate to the directory containing myZoo.java <br>
4. Execute javac myZoo.java <br>
5. Execute java myZoo <br>
6. Enter the number of days you'd like the zoo to run. <br>
